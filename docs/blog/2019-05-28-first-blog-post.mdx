If the default set of customization options of the stories in our library is not enough for you, you can write your own custom stories with our state-of-the-art parser and upload them to your own private library. If you follow the simple instructions and tutorial, our software will allow you to make pronouns, characters, locations -- and more -- customizable within the app as well. This will be a great opportunity to create fun memories with your children!
